Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.

The purpose of this project was to organize the climate weather in hawaii . Diving further into it we were supposed to look into specific months June and Decemeber to determine if the ice cream shop could sustain itself all year round. 


Results: Provide a bulleted list with three major points from the two analysis deliverables. Use images as support where needed.

1. The first month that  we lookat was june a peak summer month so that we could compare it to a winter month side by side. If you look at the table below you can see that the average temperature is 74.

3. By looking at both tables you can see that the majority of temperature readings for both month are at least above 74 degrees.

Summary: Provide a high-level summary of the results and two additional queries that you would perform to gather more weather data for June and December.
